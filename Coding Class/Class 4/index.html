    <h1>Three Football Clubs</h1>
    <h1>A Dream Team of Legends</h1>
    <p>Imagine a football squad where Lionel Messi's dribbling wizardry combines with Cristiano Ronaldo's aerial prowess, and Kevin De Bruyne's midfield mastery orchestrates the attack alongside Luka Modric's elegance. This dream team could be formed by merging the star-studded rosters of Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Manchester City.</p>
    <h2>Goalkeeping Greatness</h2>
    <p>Between the sticks, we'd have the formidable Thibaut Courtois, renowned for his exceptional shot-stopping abilities and commanding presence. His experience in high-pressure situations would be invaluable in safeguarding this dream team's goal.</p>
    <h3>A Solid Defensive Line</h3>
    <p></p>The defense would be a fortress, anchored by Sergio Ramos' leadership and Raphael Varane's aerial dominance. Aymeric Laporte's composure and ball-playing abilities would complement their strengths, while Jordi Alba's overlapping runs and Dani Carvajal's defensive solidity would provide width and defensive cover.</p>

    <h4>A Midfield Maestro</h4>
    <p>In midfield, Kevin De Bruyne would dictate the tempo with his visionary passing and creative flair. Luka Modric's elegance and experience would add a touch of class, while Frenkie de Jong's energy and versatility would complete a formidable midfield trio.</p>

    <h5>A Fearsome Attacking Trio</h5>
    <p>Up front, the attacking trident would be a force to be reckoned with. Lionel Messi, with his unparalleled dribbling skills and goal-scoring ability, would be joined by Cristiano Ronaldo, whose aerial prowess and clinical finishing would be a constant threat. Karim Benzema's intelligence and link-up play would complete this formidable attacking trio.</p>
    <h6>A Manager to Unite the Titans</h6>
    <p>To lead this dream team, Pep Guardiola's tactical acumen and ability to get the best out of his players would be essential. His experience in managing top-level clubs and his track record of success would make him the ideal choice to guide this star-studded squad to glory.</p>
